# 多What determines the renting price of an Airbnb property?

Imagine the following situation: You have been saving money for a while in a hedgefund. One day you realized that in order to maximize the long-term profitability of your savings, it's better to invest in the real estate market, specifically in the Airbnb rental business. Subsequently, one of the many question you may ask yourself are:

- 多Which variables should you look for while you're looking for properties?
- 多Where should you buy if the pricing is the only variable of interest?
- After acquiring and accommodate the property, 多which customer reviews seems to affect the price? 

The goal of this pithy project is to show you which variables derive the over-night renting price. The project doesn't have netiher a soffisticated algorithm nor ML algorithms, thus it can be read by anyone!

## Data

The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) used was a Boston Airbnb Open Data that can be found in Kaggle. Dataset consists of over 90 columns and 3.5k of records. The information can be summarized in the following categories:
- Propeties information: Number of beds, property type, Number of bathrooms, etc.
- Location: Neighbourhood, latitude, longitude. 
- Customer reviews: Customer score for location, cleanliness, etc.

## Packages
#### Data manipulization

- numpy
- pandas
- datetime *manipuling datetime format*
- regex *extract patterns from string*

#### Visualizations 

- matplotlib
- seaborn 
- folium *interactive map*
- HeatMap *heatmap*
- msno *visualizing missing data*
- Image *import images*

## Summary of the conclusions

- Some proper correlations were found between the target variable (price) and the independent variables (In the correlation section are displayed the variables).
- As expected, the properties near downtown have higher prices compared to the suburban. 
- Especial caution is needed due to Sympson's paradox across the variables.
- Customer perception is an influential set of features that derives the price
