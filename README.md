¿What determines the renting price of an Airbnb property?

Imagine the following situation: You have been saving money for a while in a hedgefund. One day you realized that in order to maximize the long-term profitability of your savings, it's better to invest in the real estate market, specifically in the Airbnb rental business. Subsequently, one of the many question you may ask yourself is ¿Which property should I buy? ¿How high can I set the price?. This analysis is right for you. The goal of this pithy project is to show you which variables derive the over-night renting price.

The project doesn't have netiher a soffisticated algorithm nor ML algorithms, thus it can be read by anyone!
